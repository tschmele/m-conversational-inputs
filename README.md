## thesis

### abstract

> This thesis investigates the correlation between a conversational input method and the player's immersion in role-playing video games. Communicating with digital assistants using natural language is becoming increasingly common. The resulting perception of computers as social actors is used in this thesis to intentionally humanize the characters in a role-playing game to create an immersive experience.
>
>A prototype based on conversational inputs was play tested by 15 participants and their experience was documented in an attached questionnaire. Their responses were analyzed for correlation between the input-method and their immersion. The analysis shows possible correlations between the input-method and the player's empathy for the characters, as well as between the player's immersion and their empathy. This thesis concludes that conversational inputs can influence the player's immersion, but the sample size is not big enough to allow for a confident generalization.
